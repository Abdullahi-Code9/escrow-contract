#![cfg(test)]
//! Regression suite for issue #491: guarantee that
//! `get_platform_fee_allocation` performs no state mutation.
//!
//! `get_platform_fee_allocation` is a public read path that callers (and
//! off-chain indexers) invoke to inspect the currently configured platform
//! fee split. It must never write to instance, persistent, or temporary
//! storage, and must never emit events — a regression here would let a
//! "read" silently rewrite ledger state or affect contract entry TTLs.
//!
//! The validation strategy: take a full ledger snapshot
//! (`Env::to_ledger_snapshot`) immediately before calling the function under
//! test, take another immediately after, and assert the two snapshots are
//! identical. `LedgerSnapshot` captures every ledger entry (instance,
//! persistent, and temporary storage across all contracts registered on the
//! `Env`, including their live-until ledger sequence / TTL) plus the ledger
//! info itself, so this is a byte-for-byte equivalent check of the entire
//! ledger state, not just the one key we expect to be read. Any future edit
//! that adds a `.set(`, `.remove(`, `.extend_ttl(`, or event publish inside
//! `get_platform_fee_allocation` (or the shared
//! `read_platform_fee_allocation` helper it calls) will change the
//! snapshot and fail this test.
